## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Breaking (WASM):** `window.executeMegaportCommand` no longer executes commands. A synchronous call blocked the JS event loop while the CLI waited on the browser's fetch transport, hanging the tab, and bypassed the mutex that guards the shared output buffers. It is kept as a deprecated stub for one release and always returns `{ error: "synchronous execution is not supported; use executeMegaportCommandAsync" }`. Use `window.executeMegaportCommandAsync` instead (ESD-1598)

### Fixed
- repair the `js/wasm` build of `./...` (the WASM config manager was missing `GetProfile`, which `auth status` needs) and enforce the full wasm build, vet, test compilation, and wasm-tagged linting in CI so wasm code stops rotting silently (ESD-1578)
- require Cisco FMC fields only when not managing locally on the `mve buy` and `mve validate` flags and JSON paths, matching the validator (ESD-1571)
- `mve buy` and `mve validate` now apply `resourceTags` from JSON input, and interactive `mve buy` now prompts for tags, matching MCR. Previously the JSON path silently dropped the documented `resourceTags` field and interactive mode never asked. The JSON path shares the same value and empty-key validation as the flags path, so non-string values and empty keys return a usage error before the order is placed

## [v1.0.0-beta.1] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- expose MCR IPsec tunnel config on vRouter interfaces (ESD-1538)
- register users, managed-account, billing-market modules
- register ix module in WASM browser build

### Fixed
- wire MCR tunnel_count to IPsec add-on and harden config parsing
- submit order under retry, poll provisioning separately (ESD-1520)
- publish stable wasm filenames and make CloudFront optional
- update wasm-publish workflow for content-hash build pipeline
- tighten JSON input value handling to match flags (ESD-1521)
- expose --asn flag on create; pass valid session-count and asn in lifecycle test
- stop spinner animating into non-TTY logs
- reject empty tag keys in buy/create JSON input (ESD-1527)
- address adversarial review findings
- align update non-interactive gate with registered flags (ESD-1550)
- treat empty partner-config flag as no update (ESD-1550)
- apply --timeout bounds each resource, not the whole run (ESD-1522)
- classify ValidationError as usage exit code (ESD-1523)
- derive changelog prev version from previous git tag
- extend nil-response guards and honor vNIC index 0 on interactive VXC (ESD-1524, ESD-1525)
- guard nil SDK responses and honor vNIC index 0 on VXC flag path (ESD-1524, ESD-1525)
- guard nil responses on service-key update and list paths (ESD-1524)
- print command errors to stderr and route status messages off stdout
- reject explicit non-positive --timeout instead of defaulting (ESD-1526)
- remove the non-functional mve restore command
- route NAT Gateway ASN through central ValidateASN

- fixup: address second-round code review feedback

## [v0.13.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- MCR ASN updates via `mcr update --mcr-asn`, with ASN range validation on buy and update paths
- One-command static web build for CDN hosting, with a content-hashed WASM filename for immutable caching
- WASM build now includes the `nat-gateway` module and the read-only `status`, `topology`, and `product` modules

### Changed
- `servicekeys update` now exits non-zero when the API reports the update was not applied (previously it warned and exited 0)
- Local web server hardened: binds to loopback by default, adds a documented `--bind` flag, and sets HTTP server timeouts
- Updated the Go toolchain to 1.26.4 and `golang.org/x/net` to v0.56.0
- Updated megaportgo to v1.13.1

### Removed
- `mve restore` command. It called the SDK's `RestoreProduct` (an un-cancel action), which requires a `CANCELLED` resource, but MVEs can only be deleted immediately (straight to `DECOMMISSIONED`) and the API rejects the terminate-later cancellation that would reach `CANCELLED`, so the command could never succeed.

### Fixed
- `servicekeys update` no longer resets `active` and `single-use` to false when those flags are omitted
- `servicekeys update`: passing both `--product-uid` and `--product-id` now errors instead of being sent to the SDK
- Client-side validation added for IX ASN, MAC address, VLAN, and rate limit
- Failed resource mutations now return a non-zero error instead of reporting success
- Usage errors (wrong argument count, `--json` parse failures, invalid integer arguments) now exit with code 2
- Buy and order calls are no longer retried on ambiguous errors, avoiding duplicate orders
- Password input masked in the WASM terminal prompt
- `apply` rollback now respects `--timeout` and uses a fresh context
- `list-market-codes` no longer emits blank market codes
- Credential keys redacted in `--log-http` output

### Removed
- Non-functional `--description` flag from `servicekeys update` (the update API does not support it)

## [v0.12.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- In-place vNIC description updates for MVE via `mve update --vnics`, with validation of vNIC entries

### Fixed
- `mve update` now honors the registered `--term` flag
- WASM: slice-valued flags (such as `--tag`) now reset correctly between invocations

## [v0.11.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- MCR Looking Glass commands for IP route, BGP route, and BGP session diagnostics
- `--base-url` flag to override the API base URL, with `--token-url` for authenticated login against it
- `--rollback-on-failure` flag on `apply`, with reporting of orphaned resources
- MVE `adminPassword` support for Cisco and Palo Alto vendor configs
- WASM `setAuthToken` now accepts an explicit environment override, with validation

### Changed
- Config profile commands now prompt securely for credentials (masked input, validated before prompting)
- Corrupt config files are preserved as `.corrupt-<timestamp>` instead of being overwritten, and backups are restricted to `0600`
- Updated megaportgo to v1.13.0

### Fixed
- `mcr update` now registers the `--term` flag
- MVE size labels such as "MVE 2/8" are normalized before validation

- DNS temporary-error detection now uses a type assertion

## [v0.9.4] - 2026-04-30
