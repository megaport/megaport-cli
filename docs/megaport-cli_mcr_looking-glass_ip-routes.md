# ip-routes

List IP routes from the MCR routing table

## Description

List IP routes from the MCR Looking Glass.

This command retrieves every route in the MCR's routing table, whatever protocol installed it. You can filter by protocol or IP address/prefix.

### Important Notes
  - The API has no protocol filter, so --protocol is applied locally after the routes are fetched

### Example Usage

```sh
  megaport-cli mcr looking-glass ip-routes [mcrUID]
  megaport-cli mcr looking-glass ip-routes [mcrUID] --protocol BGP
  megaport-cli mcr looking-glass ip-routes [mcrUID] --ip 10.0.0.0/8
  megaport-cli mcr looking-glass ip-routes [mcrUID] --protocol STATIC --ip 192.168.0.0/16
```

## Usage

```sh
megaport-cli mcr looking-glass ip-routes [flags]
```
