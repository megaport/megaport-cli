# Megaport CLI - WebAssembly (WASM) Browser Terminal

A browser-based terminal for the Megaport CLI powered by **WebAssembly (WASM)**. The
CLI is compiled to a `.wasm` binary that runs entirely in the browser, so customers can
use it without installing anything locally.

## What is This?

- **Runs in the browser** - No local installation required
- **Powered by WebAssembly** - Go code compiled to WASM runs directly in the browser
- **In-browser authentication** - Credentials stay in browser memory; the WASM calls the Megaport API directly, with no server-side component
- **XTerm.js Terminal** - Full-featured terminal emulator with ANSI support
- **Early Release** - Covers all registered resource modules (see Available Commands below). Auth, config, completion, `generate-docs`, and `version` are not applicable in the browser.

## How Customers Use It

The browser CLI is embedded in the Megaport Portal, which loads the WASM binary from the
CDN (`s3://media.megaport.com/portal/megaport-cli/`) and runs it in-page. There is no
server to deploy: the front end loads static assets and the WASM authenticates against
the Megaport API directly.

### Available Commands

The WASM build registers the following modules. Each module exposes the same subcommands it provides in the native CLI (so `partners` is still `list` / `find`, `locations` is still `list` / `get`, and so on), subject to the constraints of running in the browser:

- `locations` - Find Megaport locations and metros
- `ports` - Manage Megaport ports (including LAG ports)
- `mcr` - Manage Megaport Cloud Routers
- `mve` - Manage Megaport Virtual Edge devices
- `vxc` - Manage Virtual Cross Connects
- `nat-gateway` - Manage NAT gateways
- `partners` - Look up cloud partner ports
- `product` - Inspect provisioned products
- `servicekeys` - Manage service keys
- `status` - Check resource provisioning status
- `topology` - View network topology

The registered list is the source of truth in `cmd/megaport/modules_wasm.go`. Any module not registered there is unavailable in the WASM build, including `auth`, `config`, `completion`, `generate-docs`, `version`, `ix`, `users`, `apply`, `managed-account`, and `billing-market`. Some rely on the local filesystem (profile storage, completion scripts); others have simply not been wired into the browser build yet.

**Output Formats**: The WASM build supports the following output formats:

- `--output table` (default) - Formatted table with styled output
- `--output json` - JSON format for programmatic use
- `--output csv` - CSV format for data export
- `--output xml` - XML format

`--output go-template` is not supported in WASM/browser builds.

**Example Commands**:

```bash
megaport-cli locations list
megaport-cli locations list --output json
megaport-cli ports list
megaport-cli ports get <portUID>
megaport-cli vxc list --status LIVE
megaport-cli partners list --company-name "Amazon Web Services"
```

## Authentication

Authentication happens entirely in the browser. There is no login server, session
token, or API proxy.

- **Standalone demo**: a credential form calls the WASM's `setAuthCredentials`, which
  holds your access key and secret key in memory for the lifetime of the page. The WASM
  uses them to sign requests to the Megaport API directly.
- **Portal integration**: the host page passes an existing session token via the WASM's
  `setAuthToken`, so the user doesn't re-enter credentials.

Credentials and tokens live only in browser memory and are cleared on reload or when the
page calls `clearAuthCredentials`.

## Interactive Mode

Some commands prompt for input (interactive `buy`/`update` flows, confirmations, secrets).
In the browser there is no stdin, so the WASM asks the host page for each value through a
small set of JavaScript functions. Wire these up or interactive commands will never
receive a response.

### Async entrypoint is required

Run any command that may prompt through **`executeMegaportCommandAsync(command, callback)`**,
never the legacy synchronous **`executeMegaportCommand(command)`**.

The sync entrypoint runs the command inline on the JS→WASM call, so a prompt would block
the event loop and the host could never deliver a response. Under the sync entrypoint the
CLI no longer hangs on a prompt: a command that prompts for a value (text, password, or
resource input) fails fast with an error telling you to use the async entrypoint, and a
yes/no confirmation is treated as declined. Either way, run interactive commands through
the async entrypoint so prompts work as intended.

### Host functions

The WASM registers these on `window` at startup:

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `registerPromptHandler(cb)` | Register a callback the WASM invokes with each prompt request. |
| `submitPromptResponse(id, response)` | Reply to the prompt `id` with the user's input (a string). |
| `cancelPrompt(id)` | Cancel the prompt `id`; the command receives a "prompt cancelled by user" error. |

### Prompt request shape

Your handler receives a single object:

```js
{
  id: "prompt_1_1700000000000000000", // unique id; echo it back in submit/cancel
  message: "Enter port name:",         // text to show the user
  type: "text",                        // "text" | "confirm" | "password" | "resource"
  resourceType: "port"                 // set for resource and secret-resource prompts (port, mcr, vxc, ...), else ""
}
```

Mask the input when `type === "password"`: render an `<input type="password">` or otherwise
hide the characters. Password prompts and secret-resource prompts (for example VXC/MVE
passwords and pre-shared keys) set this type. Note that some other secret-bearing inputs
(such as partner auth/service/shared keys and MVE registration keys) are currently sent as
`type === "resource"`, so don't rely on the password type alone if you want to mask every
possible secret.

### Lifecycle

```js
registerPromptHandler((request) => {
  const masked = request.type === 'password';
  showPrompt(request.message, { masked }).then((answer) => {
    if (answer === null) {
      cancelPrompt(request.id);        // user dismissed the prompt
    } else {
      submitPromptResponse(request.id, answer);
    }
  });
});

executeMegaportCommandAsync('vxc buy --interactive', (result) => {
  console.log(result.output || result.error);
});
```

A prompt left unanswered times out after 5 minutes and the command receives an error.

> **Output streaming:** interactive commands currently return their full output only when
> the command completes. Live, incremental output streaming is tracked separately and this
> section will document the subscription API once it lands.

## Building

The browser CLI is two pieces: the WASM binary and the Vue front end that hosts it.

```bash
# WASM binary only (writes web/megaport.wasm)
make wasm

# Full static site: WASM + Vue front end, assembled into web/vue-demo/
make web-static          # or: ./scripts/build-web.sh
```

`web-static` needs the Go toolchain and Node/npm on `PATH`. It produces a self-contained
**`web/vue-demo/`** directory (Vue build + `megaport.wasm` + `wasm_exec.js`) ready to
publish to a CDN. See [`web/README.md`](web/README.md) for the wasm pre-compression and
cache-header details.

## Local Development

The front end lives in `frontend-integration/` and has its own Vite dev server. The dev
server serves files from that directory's root and has no `public/` dir, so build the wasm
and copy the loader into `frontend-integration/` first, then start the server:

```bash
# From the repo root: build the wasm + loader into the dev server's root.
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -tags js,wasm -o frontend-integration/megaport.wasm .
cp "$(go env GOROOT)/lib/wasm/wasm_exec.js" frontend-integration/wasm_exec.js

cd frontend-integration
npm install
npm run dev:demo
```

Vite serves `megaport.wasm` with the correct `application/wasm` MIME type and reloads the
front end on change. Rerun the build command above after changing Go code.

## Enabling a Module for WASM

Every module follows the same recipe to go from native-only to browser-enabled:

1. **Register it.** Add the module to `registerModules()` in
   `cmd/megaport/modules_wasm.go` (import the package and call
   `moduleRegistry.Register(<module>.NewModule())`). This file is the source of
   truth for what ships in the browser build.

2. **Build the guard.** Run `make wasm-build-guard`
   (`GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -tags js,wasm -o /dev/null .`). This fails if
   the module pulls in anything that does not compile under `js/wasm` (native
   filesystem, `os/exec`, `syscall`, etc.). CI runs the same step on every PR.

3. **Add a `_wasm` override only if needed.** An override is needed when the
   native action builds its own `http.Client` instead of going through
   `config.Login(ctx)` or `config.NewUnauthenticatedClient()` — the WASM
   versions of those functions already use the browser fetch transport, so any
   module that calls them directly needs no override. A module needs a
   `<module>_actions_wasm.go` (`//go:build js && wasm`) only when its native
   path does something the browser can't, such as reading the local filesystem
   or constructing its own `http.Client`. The pattern is to override the
   action's function variable in `init()`, using
   `config.NewUnauthenticatedClient()` for public endpoints or
   `config.Login(ctx)` for authenticated ones. If you need a reference,
   `internal/commands/ports/ports_actions_wasm.go` shows the authenticated
   pattern.

4. **Smoke-test it.** Run `make wasm-smoke` to round-trip a command through the
   browser fetch transport against a live API (defaults to `locations list`
   against staging, no credentials needed). Requires Node.js 22+ on `PATH`. To
   exercise a specific module:

   ```bash
   WASM_SMOKE_COMMAND='locations list --output json' make wasm-smoke
   ```

   The command must emit JSON (`--output json`) and return a non-empty JSON
   array (use a `list` subcommand, not a single-resource `get`). For anything
   that needs auth, set `MEGAPORT_ACCESS_KEY` / `MEGAPORT_SECRET_KEY` in the
   environment first (local use only; do not add credentials to the CI smoke
   job).

## Publishing to the Portal

The Portal loads the WASM binary from `s3://media.megaport.com/portal/megaport-cli/`. Publishing is currently manual.

### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with SSO for the `ProductionDeveloper` role.

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Ensure AWS SSO auth is active (login if needed)
aws sso login
aws sts get-caller-identity
# 2. Build the WASM binary and copy the matching wasm_exec.js loader. The loader is
#    not checked in: copy it fresh from the toolchain so it stays paired with the Go
#    version that built the wasm (./wasm.sh does both steps if you prefer).
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -tags js,wasm -o web/megaport.wasm .
cp "$(go env GOROOT)/lib/wasm/wasm_exec.js" web/wasm_exec.js

# 3. Upload the WASM binary and the wasm_exec.js loader.
#    `--content-type application/wasm` is required so the file isn't served as
#    application/octet-stream: `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming` rejects anything
#    else, which would break loading the WASM in the browser.
aws s3 cp web/megaport.wasm s3://media.megaport.com/portal/megaport-cli/megaport.wasm \
    --content-type application/wasm
aws s3 cp web/wasm_exec.js  s3://media.megaport.com/portal/megaport-cli/wasm_exec.js
```

For CDN hosting (S3 + CloudFront) of the full static site, sync the assembled
`web/vue-demo/` directory and serve it from the site root:

```bash
make web-static
aws s3 sync web/vue-demo/ s3://<bucket>/<prefix>/ --delete
```

`--delete` prunes stale hashed assets from old builds, so point it at a prefix dedicated
to this site, since it removes anything else under that prefix.

## Troubleshooting

### Can't build WASM

```bash
# Make sure you have Go 1.25 or later (matches go.mod)
go version

# Check WASM support
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go version
```

### Can't connect to Megaport API

The browser calls the Megaport API directly, so debug from the browser:

- open the dev tools Network tab and inspect the failing request
- confirm the access key / secret key are correct for the selected environment
